# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 1.6.0

### New

- **Redesigned Wi‑Fi widget**: The popup is now a compact Wi‑Fi control center instead of a flat SSID/RSSI/Noise/Channel readout.
  - **Nearby networks**: Scans and lists nearby Wi‑Fi networks (via CoreWLAN), sorted by signal strength, with security-type badges and a scrollable "Show More Networks" list capped at a sensible height.
  - **Direct connection**: Tap an open network to join immediately, or a secured one to get an inline password prompt (with a "Remember this network" toggle) right in the popup — no more dropping into System Settings. Explicit Connecting/Connected/Failed/Incorrect-password states throughout.
  - **Wi‑Fi on/off**: A toggle in the popup header turns Wi‑Fi on or off directly.
  - **Network details**: Tapping the current network opens a compact details view — signal quality, security type, IP address, frequency band, and a "Forget This Network" action.
  - **Wi‑Fi Settings shortcut**: Deep-links straight to the System Settings Wi‑Fi pane.
  - Adopts `ConditionallyActivatableWidget` (like Battery) so the underlying CoreWLAN/NWPathMonitor polling only runs while the widget is actually displayed, and now honors Performance Mode's polling interval instead of a hardcoded 15s timer. Nearby-network scanning only ever runs while the popup is open, never in the background.
  - **Known networks reconnect silently**: tapping a network macOS already has a saved password for re-joins immediately instead of prompting again — matching the native menu's "Known Network" behavior. Falls back to the password screen automatically if a silent rejoin doesn't stick.
  - **Menu bar icon**: Wi‑Fi off now greys out the icon instead of hiding it (so there's still something to click to turn it back on), and "Connecting…" now animates instead of sitting static.

### Bug Fixes

- **Wi‑Fi menu bar icon disappeared when Wi‑Fi was turned off**: `NWPathMonitor` reports "no Wi‑Fi interface" identically for "no Wi‑Fi hardware" and "Wi‑Fi hardware present but powered off," so the icon-hiding logic treated a user turning Wi‑Fi off (from the new in-popup toggle, or System Settings) the same as a Mac with no Wi‑Fi card at all. Now reads power state directly from CoreWLAN instead.

## 1.5.0

### New

- **Unified "AI Agent Usage" widget**: Replaces the separate Claude Usage, Codex Usage, and OpenCode widgets with a single widget covering Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Cursor. Compact agent switcher → account picker → detail view, with an overview mode showing every agent's usage at a glance and a warning banner when one is approaching its limit.
  - **Multiple accounts per agent**: Claude Code now supports real multiple accounts (add/rename/remove/sign-in-again), each with its own Keychain-stored OAuth tokens. Existing single-account logins migrate in place automatically.
  - **Codex** accounts are tracked as remembered local logins (OpenAI has no free usage-check endpoint, so only the account currently logged into the Codex CLI shows live data — others prompt to switch via `codex login`).
  - **OpenCode** folds into the same architecture with no change to how its usage is read.
  - **Cursor** is wired in as a selectable agent that honestly reports "usage isn't available yet" — no data source exists for it yet, so nothing is faked.
  - Redesigned UI: rounded "island" cards replace hairline dividers, a sliding-pill agent switcher, tinted brand icons, hover/press feedback, and small usage rings in overview mode.
  - Existing configs migrate automatically: the old `default.claude-usage`/`default.codex-usage`/`default.opencode-usage` widget entries and their saved thresholds carry over to the new `default.agent-usage` widget on next launch.

### Bug Fixes

- **Codex Usage: rate-limit data silently dropped**: OpenAI's backend sometimes sends `credits.balance` as a JSON string (e.g. `"0"`) instead of a number. The strict `Double` decode this hit was nested under a single `try?`, so one bad field silently discarded the *entire* rate-limit snapshot — the widget looked like it had no usage data even when a valid one was sitting in the session log. Now accepts either a number or a numeric string.
- **Codex Usage: account list could stay empty**: if `auth.json` didn't yield a `chatgpt_account_id`/`chatgpt_user_id` fingerprint, the widget never registered an account to show, so it got stuck on an empty "no accounts yet" screen even while signed in and connected. Falls back to a local placeholder account so real usage still displays.
- **Codex Usage widget: excessive CPU use**: Refreshes now coalesce overlapping scans and read only the latest 20 session transcripts, using the final 512 KB of each transcript. This avoids repeatedly parsing the full Codex history, which can contain very large JSONL session files. (Pulled in from upstream `MateoCerquetella/barik-enhanced@6ef80f1`.)
- **Claude Usage widget: overlapping refreshes**: Refresh requests now coalesce instead of overlapping under rapid wake/reload triggers.

### Performance

- **Cut idle CPU across widgets**: fewer redundant SwiftUI redraws, moved Wi-Fi (CoreWLAN) reads off the main thread, cached and serialized Now Playing AppleScript execution instead of recompiling/re-dispatching it every poll, matched Now Playing players by bundle identifier, folded a redundant AeroSpace CLI call into the main listing, and backed off the Spaces poll timer once AeroSpace's event hook proves reliable.

## 1.4.2

### Bug Fixes
- **Update check pointed at upstream repo**: The "Update" pill checked `MateoCerquetella/barik-enhanced` releases, so upstream cutting a new version triggered a false update prompt in this fork. Now checks `pratyay2374/barik-enhanced` instead.
- **Changelog popup pointed at upstream repo**: The in-app "What's New" changelog fetched `CHANGELOG.md` from upstream instead of this fork.

### Other
- Removed Homebrew cask install instructions/rules — this fork is distributed via zip download from GitHub Releases only.

## 1.3.6

### Improvements
- **Pinned right-side layout**: Widgets after the first spacer/divider are now in an independent ZStack layer anchored to the right edge — they never shift when left-side content (e.g. AeroSpace window titles) changes width. Left-side widgets are clipped instead of pushing the right side.
- **Spaces widget: smart title truncation**: Focused window titles auto-trim to 20 characters when a space has more than 3 windows (instead of the default 50), keeping spaces compact.
- **Vertical centering**: Both ZStack layers fill the full bar height so widgets are vertically centered.

## 1.3.5

### Improvements
- **Subtle full-screen background blur**: Reverted to the upstream Barik blur style — full-screen `Material` blur with no rounded corners, shadows, or strokes. Configurable via `blur` (1–6 intensity, 7 = black).
- **NSPanel transparency fix**: The background and menu bar panels now set `isOpaque = false` with layer-backed hosting views, ensuring `Material` blur composites correctly.

### Bug Fixes
- **Claude Usage widget: repeated keychain password prompts**: The Claude Usage widget read Claude Code's keychain item (`Claude Code-credentials`) on every refresh — the 60-second timer plus a burst on every wake/screen-wake — which popped the macOS "Barik Enhanced wants to access key" dialog over and over. ("Always Allow" never stuck because Claude Code resets that item's access list whenever it refreshes its own OAuth token.) The widget now caches the token in memory and reuses it until it actually expires, so background refreshes never touch the keychain. The keychain is only read on first connect, when you press "Allow Access", or once the token has expired.

## 1.3.3

### Bug Fixes
- **Time + settings gear hidden on narrow displays**: After 1.3.2 made the bar edge-to-edge by default, the rightmost widgets (clock and settings cog) were drawn underneath the native macOS status icons on narrow screens (e.g., 16" MacBook at "Larger Text" scaling). Wide-screen layouts are unchanged. Narrow displays (effective width under 1500pt) now automatically reserve enough trailing space to keep the time and gear visible. Override with `experimental.foreground.system-status-reservation` in your config (set to `0` to force edge-to-edge).

### Improvements
- **Time widget margin**: Added a small leading gap before the time so it doesn't sit flush against the preceding widget.

## 1.3.2

### Improvements
- **Full-width menu bar**: The bar now extends edge-to-edge by default. The fixed 220pt trailing reservation introduced in 1.3.1 (to avoid Hidden Bar / Bartender jitter) is gone — set `experimental.foreground.horizontalPadding` in your config if you still want a cushion before the native status area.
- **Universal binary**: Now shipped as a universal app (arm64 + x86_64). Apple Silicon Macs run the native slice instead of going through Rosetta.

### Bug Fixes
- **Homebrew install name**: The built app is now natively produced as `BarikEnhanced.app` (matching the Homebrew cask), instead of `Barik.app` that brew had to rename on install. Bundle identifier (`com.mateocerquetella.BarikEnhanced`) is unchanged, so existing installs upgrade in place.
- **Display name**: Corrected `CFBundleDisplayName` from the accidental "BarikEnhanced Enhanced" introduced during the project rename back to "Barik Enhanced".

### Internal
- Renamed the source tree, Xcode project, scheme, and entitlements from `Barik` → `BarikEnhanced` to match the distributed product name. No functional changes.

## 1.3.1

### Bug Fixes
- **Layout jitter with Hidden Bar / Bartender**: Stopped reacting to changes in the native status-area width. Toggling utilities like Hidden Bar no longer causes Barik's trailing widgets (clock, gear) to shift. The trailing reservation is now a fixed conservative width — adjust `experimental.foreground.horizontalPadding` in your config if you need more space.

## 1.3.0

### New Features
- **OpenCode Usage widget**: Track OpenCode Go subscription usage from the menu bar. Outer ring shows the rolling 5-hour window, inner ring shows the weekly window, and the terminal icon drains to indicate monthly remaining. Numbers come from the local opencode message database (`~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`); a one-tap link in the popup opens the official dashboard at `opencode.ai/auth` for the authoritative numbers — opencode does not yet expose a public usage API ([feature request #16017](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/16017)).

### Improvements
- **Codex Usage widget**: Now surfaces both the primary and secondary rate-limit windows when the latest session snapshot reports them, mirroring how the Codex CLI reports usage.

## 1.2.9

### Bug Fixes
- Restored the application codebase to the stable `1.2.6` implementation while releasing it as `1.2.9`.

## 1.2.6

### Improvements
- **Codex / Claude usage widgets**: Standardized both widgets to refresh every 60 seconds and added manual reload support.
- **App updates**: Changed automatic release checks to run every 4 hours, with immediate checks after wake and session activation.

### Bug Fixes
- **Claude usage access**: Prevented background refreshes from repeatedly prompting for Keychain or sudo-style password access. Only the explicit Allow Access action can show the system prompt.
- **Wake recovery**: Reconnects Codex and Claude usage checks after lid close/open, screen wake, and session reactivation with immediate and delayed refresh attempts.
- **Popup clicks**: Rebuilds popup panels after display and wake changes, fixes multi-screen popup positioning, and restores panel ordering so widget clicks keep working.
- **Time widget visibility**: Keeps the configured time widget in a protected trailing slot so it remains fully visible before the native macOS status area.

## 1.2.5

### Improvements
- **Codex / Claude usage widgets**: Added an in-popup settings view to adjust warning and critical thresholds without editing the TOML file manually. The widgets and popup progress bars now react to your saved thresholds immediately.
- **About menu**: Fixed the main GitHub link so it points to the `barik-enhanced` repository.

### Bug Fixes
- **Status area recovery**: Improved native macOS status area measurement refresh after wake, screen wake, and session reactivation so the bar recovers more reliably from sleep and display changes.

## 1.2.4

### Bug Fixes
- **What's New / Update banner spacing**: Fixed the system banner reserving empty space between the settings gear and the trailing edge when no visible banner was being shown. The banner container now collapses completely unless it has real content.

## 1.2.3

### Bug Fixes
- **AeroSpace Spaces widget**: Fixed the Spaces widget getting stale after long uptimes, wake cycles, day changes, or transient AeroSpace command failures. The widget now re-detects the provider, refreshes on recovery events, and keeps the last good state instead of clearing itself on temporary errors.

### Improvements
- Added a new **Reload** widget to manually reload config and refresh widgets from the menu bar
- Improved AeroSpace command execution with timeout handling and reduced redundant queries
- Restored the app display name/version for the new release

## 1.2.2

### Bug Fixes
- **Background bar trailing gap**: Fixed recurring gap between the background bar's right edge and the system status area. Removed inflated measurement offset and added overlap margin so the background always reaches the system icons cleanly.

## 1.2.1

### Bug Fixes
- **Background bar gap**: Fixed the background bar extending beyond widget area after updates, causing a visible black gap between the last widget and the right edge. Background now respects system status area width on the trailing side.

## 1.2.0

### Bug Fixes
- **Window Level Recovery**: Fixed widgets appearing on top of everything after a system crash or freeze. Panel window levels are now re-applied automatically to self-correct corrupted z-ordering.

### Improvements
- Added wake-from-sleep observer to reset panels after sleep/wake cycles, preventing stale window state

## 1.1.1

### Improvements
- Fix widget spacing on small screens (MacBook) — widgets no longer wrap or overlap
- Fix changelog popup pointing to wrong repository
- Fix "What's new" banner leaving empty gap when dismissed
- Auto-detect native macOS status area width precisely using invisible probe
- Updater now checks for updates from the correct repository

## 1.1.0

### Bug Fixes
- **CPU Monitor**: Fixed CPU usage always showing 0%. The previous implementation used an incorrect `sysctlbyname("vm.loadavg")` call that always failed. Switched to `host_processor_info()` with proper memory management.
- **Memory Safety**: Fixed a use-after-free bug in the CPU monitor that caused memory corruption. A `defer` block was incorrectly freeing memory still needed for delta calculations between update cycles.
- **Widget Overlap**: Fixed Barik widgets overlapping with native macOS status bar items (WiFi, battery, clock, Control Center). Added automatic detection of the system status area width using an invisible `NSStatusItem` probe.

### Improvements
- Right padding now dynamically adjusts to the actual width of native macOS menu bar items
- CPU usage now shows accurate per-core aggregated values with user/system breakdown
